          I obtained my degree as a civil engineer in August 2015 from the
          National University of Colombia. There I learned about every area of
          civil engineering such as project management; it gave me a real
          concept about the complexity and variety of disciplines involves in
          engineering and communication. After my graduation I had the
          opportunity to work for several companies; when I worked as a
          superintendent in the construction field, I was in charge of around
          300 workers and assisted to weekly meetings with other groupâ€™s leaders
          to schedule the next week's activities.

          After I had the chance to work as quality control for several
          companies, because of my position, I had to learn how to communicate
          with diplomacy to the other actors, in order to make my criticism the
          most constructive possible. Regarding my educational live, being
          Colombian, I had the opportunity to live in Ireland during 2017,
          sharing with people from every part of the world and improving my
          languages skills. Lately, I have been living in Hungary since
          September 2019, where I share in my daily basis with people from all
          the continents.
